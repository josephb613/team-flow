Agent: subagent
Task: Add Drag-and-Drop Kanban, Enhanced Search Dialog, Task Detail Drawer Integration

Work Log:
- **Drag-and-Drop Kanban**: Integrated @dnd-kit/core and @dnd-kit/sortable into tasks-view.tsx. Each task card is a SortableTaskCard using useSortable hook. Each column is a DroppableKanbanColumn using useDroppable. onDragStart/onDragOver/onDragEnd handlers manage task movement between columns. DragOverlay shows rotated preview. Columns being dragged over get teal ring highlight and background tint.
- **Enhanced Search Dialog**: Added real-time search filtering through mockTasks, mockProjects, and mockUsers. Three new CommandGroup sections: Tasks (status icon + priority dot), Projects (color dot + progress %), Members (avatar + online status + role). Click handlers: task→tasks+drawer, project→projects, member→members. Results limited to 5 per category. Added i18n keys for search.tasks/projects/members.
- **Task Detail Drawer Integration**: Added TaskDetailDrawer component to main-app.tsx. All task cards (Kanban, List, My Tasks) are clickable via setSelectedTask from the store, opening the drawer with full task details.

Stage Summary:
- Full drag-and-drop kanban board with visual feedback
- Search dialog now searches actual data (tasks, projects, members)
- Task detail drawer opens on task click from any view
- 0 lint errors

## Task ID: 9
Agent: subagent
Task: Polish Login Page + Add WebSocket Chat Service

Work Log:
- **Login Page Polish**: Added animated stats ticker (10K+ Teams, 2M+ Tasks, 99.9% Uptime, 150+ Countries) with AnimatedCounter component. Added floating glass-morphism testimonial card with avatar, name, role, company, 5-star rating, and Framer Motion float animation. Added "Remember me" checkbox with teal accent.

---

## Unresolved Issues / Risks
1. **Dev server stability**: The Next.js dev server process occasionally dies between commands in the sandbox. May need to use a more robust process manager.
2. **Agent-browser localhost access**: The headless Chrome instance cannot reach localhost from within the sandbox. External URLs work fine. QA testing currently relies on curl and code review.
3. **Chat service persistence**: Messages are stored in memory only and lost on restart. Could add file-based or SQLite persistence.

## Priority Recommendations for Next Phase
1. **Drag-and-Drop for task reordering within columns** (currently only cross-column)
2. **File upload functionality** in Files view (currently UI only)
3. **Real-time notifications** via WebSocket (push new notifications to clients)
4. **Data persistence** — Connect more views to the Prisma database instead of mock data
5. **Mobile responsive improvements** — Fine-tune all views for smaller screens
6. **Keyboard shortcuts** — Add more keyboard navigation throughout the app

- Verified lint passes with 0 errors
- Verified dev server compiles and returns 200
- Identified areas for improvement: no DnD on kanban, basic search, no task drawer integration, login page needs polish, no real-time features
- Delegated work to 2 subagents in parallel:
  - Subagent 1: DnD kanban + enhanced search + task drawer integration
  - Subagent 2: Login page polish + WebSocket chat service
- Verified all features integrated correctly
- Verified both servers running (Next.js:3000, Chat:3003)
- Updated worklog.md with comprehensive status

Stage Summary:
- Project status: Stable, 0 errors, both servers running
- 3 major features added: DnD kanban, enhanced search, task detail drawer
- Login page polished with testimonials, stats, password toggle, shimmer
- Real-time chat service created with socket.io on port 3003
- Messages view integrated with WebSocket for live messaging
Task: Add three major features: DnD Kanban, Enhanced Search, Task Detail Drawer integration

Work Log:

**Feature 1: Drag-and-Drop for Kanban Board** (`tasks-view.tsx`):
- Imported DndContext, DragOverlay, closestCorners, PointerSensor, KeyboardSensor, useDroppable from @dnd-kit/core
- Imported SortableContext, useSortable, verticalListSortingStrategy, sortableKeyboardCoordinates from @dnd-kit/sortable
- Imported CSS from @dnd-kit/utilities
- Created `TaskCardContent` base component (extracted from original `TaskCard`) - renders the visual card without DnD
- Created `SortableTaskCard` component using `useSortable` hook - wraps TaskCardContent with DnD transform/transition/opacity
- Created `DroppableKanbanColumn` component using `useDroppable` hook - each column is a droppable area
- Implemented `handleDragStart` - tracks active dragged task ID
- Implemented `handleDragOver` - when task dragged over different column, updates its status in local state; tracks overColumn for visual feedback
- Implemented `handleDragEnd` - finalizes the drag operation
- Added `DragOverlay` with rotated/opacity-styled task card preview when dragging
- Added visual feedback: columns being dragged over get ring-2 ring-[oklch] border highlight and background tint
- Local `useState<Task[]>` initialized from mockTasks manages task list within KanbanView
- All existing styling preserved (priority strips, avatars, badges, subtask progress, etc.)
- "Add task" button still works in each column

**Feature 2: Enhanced Search Dialog with Real Results** (`search-dialog.tsx`):
- Imported mockTasks, mockProjects, mockUsers from @/lib/mock-data
- Added useTranslation() for i18n support
- Added query state with `useState` for search input
- Added `useMemo` filtering logic for tasks (by title), projects (by name), users (by name)
- Results limited to 5 per category
- Added "Tasks" CommandGroup: matching tasks with status icon (color-coded) and priority dot/icon
- Added "Projects" CommandGroup: matching projects with color dot and progress percentage
- Added "Members" CommandGroup: matching users with avatar initials, online status dot, and role badge
- Clicking task result: sets activePage to 'tasks' AND opens task detail drawer via setSelectedTask
- Clicking project result: sets activePage to 'projects'
- Clicking member result: sets activePage to 'members'
- Proper icons for each group header from lucide-react
- Reset query on dialog close via onOpenChange handler (avoiding lint error with setState-in-effect)
- Added i18n keys `search.tasks`, `search.projects`, `search.members` to both FR and EN translations

**Feature 3: Integrate Task Detail Drawer** (`main-app.tsx` + `tasks-view.tsx`):
- Imported TaskDetailDrawer in main-app.tsx and rendered alongside NotificationPanel
- In KanbanView: each SortableTaskCard has onClick that calls `setSelectedTask(task)` from store
- In ListView: each task row has onClick that calls `setSelectedTask(task)` from store
- In MyTasksView: each task row has onClick that calls `setSelectedTask(task)` from store
- cursor-pointer already present on task cards and rows
- Drawer opens with selected task details when any task card is clicked

**Additional fixes:**
- Fixed pre-existing lint error in use-chat-socket.ts: removed redundant useEffect for channel switching that called setState in effect
- All lint errors resolved: `bun run lint` passes with 0 errors

Stage Summary:
- Kanban board now has full drag-and-drop between columns with visual feedback
- Search dialog searches through real tasks, projects, and members data
- Task detail drawer is integrated and opens on task click from all views
- 0 lint errors
- App compiling and serving successfully on port 3000

# Cron Review Round — Current Status

## Project Status Assessment
TeamFlow is a fully-featured collaborative project management web app. All 14 views are implemented and functional. The app includes a login page, sidebar navigation, dashboard with charts, AI chat assistant, time tracker, and real-time WebSocket chat. The color scheme uses teal/emerald accents consistently. Both the Next.js dev server (port 3000) and the chat service (port 3003) are running without errors.

## Completed Modifications
1. **Bug Fixes**: PageTransition animation stuck (opacity:0), React hydration errors (Math.random, Date formatting), toggleSidebar undefined reference
2. **Styling**: Login page particles/trust badges/footer links/shimmer, Sidebar quick stats/tooltips/separators/collapse, Dashboard greeting/quick actions/heatmap, Top Bar focus mode
3. **New Features**: AI Chat Assistant Widget (floating, contextual responses), Time Tracker Widget (timer, today summary, recent entries)

## Unresolved Issues / Risks
1. **Agent-browser form filling**: The `agent-browser fill` command doesn't properly trigger React state updates in some cases; had to use JS dispatch as workaround
2. **Activity Heatmap**: Uses deterministic pseudo-random; should eventually use real data from API
3. **AI Chat responses**: Currently simulated with keyword matching; should integrate with LLM API for real AI responses
4. **Mobile responsiveness**: Some views may need fine-tuning for smaller screens
5. **Data persistence**: Most views still use mock data; should connect more views to the Prisma database

## Priority Recommendations for Next Phase
1. **Integrate LLM API** for AI Chat Assistant (using z-ai-web-dev-sdk)
2. **Connect more views to database** (tasks, projects, etc.) instead of mock data
3. **Mobile responsive improvements** — fine-tune all views for smaller screens
4. **File upload functionality** in Files view
5. **Real-time notifications** via WebSocket push
6. **Keyboard shortcuts** — expand keyboard navigation throughout the app
