Agent: subagent
Task: Add Drag-and-Drop Kanban, Enhanced Search Dialog, Task Detail Drawer Integration

Work Log:
- **Drag-and-Drop Kanban**: Integrated @dnd-kit/core and @dnd-kit/sortable into tasks-view.tsx. Each task card is a SortableTaskCard using useSortable hook. Each column is a DroppableKanbanColumn using useDroppable. onDragStart/onDragOver/onDragEnd handlers manage task movement between columns. DragOverlay shows rotated preview. Columns being dragged over get teal ring highlight and background tint.
- **Enhanced Search Dialog**: Added real-time search filtering through mockTasks, mockProjects, and mockUsers. Three new CommandGroup sections: Tasks (status icon + priority dot), Projects (color dot + progress %), Members (avatar + online status + role). Click handlers: task→tasks+drawer, project→projects, member→members. Results limited to 5 per category. Added i18n keys for search.tasks/projects/members.
- **Task Detail Drawer Integration**: Added TaskDetailDrawer component to main-app.tsx. All task cards (Kanban, List, My Tasks) are clickable via setSelectedTask from the store, opening the drawer with full task details.

Stage Summary:
- Full drag-and-drop kanban board with visual feedback
- Search dialog now searches actual data (tasks, projects, members)
- Task detail drawer opens on task click from any view
- 0 lint errors

## Task ID: 9
Agent: subagent
Task: Polish Login Page + Add WebSocket Chat Service

Work Log:
- **Login Page Polish**: Added animated stats ticker (10K+ Teams, 2M+ Tasks, 99.9% Uptime, 150+ Countries) with AnimatedCounter component. Added floating glass-morphism testimonial card with avatar, name, role, company, 5-star rating, and Framer Motion float animation. Added "Remember me" checkbox with teal accent.

---

## Unresolved Issues / Risks
1. **Dev server stability**: The Next.js dev server process occasionally dies between commands in the sandbox. May need to use a more robust process manager.
2. **Agent-browser localhost access**: The headless Chrome instance cannot reach localhost from within the sandbox. External URLs work fine. QA testing currently relies on curl and code review.
3. **Chat service persistence**: Messages are stored in memory only and lost on restart. Could add file-based or SQLite persistence.

## Priority Recommendations for Next Phase
1. **Drag-and-Drop for task reordering within columns** (currently only cross-column)
2. **File upload functionality** in Files view (currently UI only)
3. **Real-time notifications** via WebSocket (push new notifications to clients)
4. **Data persistence** — Connect more views to the Prisma database instead of mock data
5. **Mobile responsive improvements** — Fine-tune all views for smaller screens
6. **Keyboard shortcuts** — Add more keyboard navigation throughout the app

- Verified lint passes with 0 errors
- Verified dev server compiles and returns 200
- Identified areas for improvement: no DnD on kanban, basic search, no task drawer integration, login page needs polish, no real-time features
- Delegated work to 2 subagents in parallel:
  - Subagent 1: DnD kanban + enhanced search + task drawer integration
  - Subagent 2: Login page polish + WebSocket chat service
- Verified all features integrated correctly
- Verified both servers running (Next.js:3000, Chat:3003)
- Updated worklog.md with comprehensive status

Stage Summary:
- Project status: Stable, 0 errors, both servers running
- 3 major features added: DnD kanban, enhanced search, task detail drawer
- Login page polished with testimonials, stats, password toggle, shimmer
- Real-time chat service created with socket.io on port 3003
- Messages view integrated with WebSocket for live messaging
Task: Add three major features: DnD Kanban, Enhanced Search, Task Detail Drawer integration

Work Log:

**Feature 1: Drag-and-Drop for Kanban Board** (`tasks-view.tsx`):
- Imported DndContext, DragOverlay, closestCorners, PointerSensor, KeyboardSensor, useDroppable from @dnd-kit/core
- Imported SortableContext, useSortable, verticalListSortingStrategy, sortableKeyboardCoordinates from @dnd-kit/sortable
- Imported CSS from @dnd-kit/utilities
- Created `TaskCardContent` base component (extracted from original `TaskCard`) - renders the visual card without DnD
- Created `SortableTaskCard` component using `useSortable` hook - wraps TaskCardContent with DnD transform/transition/opacity
- Created `DroppableKanbanColumn` component using `useDroppable` hook - each column is a droppable area
- Implemented `handleDragStart` - tracks active dragged task ID
- Implemented `handleDragOver` - when task dragged over different column, updates its status in local state; tracks overColumn for visual feedback
- Implemented `handleDragEnd` - finalizes the drag operation
- Added `DragOverlay` with rotated/opacity-styled task card preview when dragging
- Added visual feedback: columns being dragged over get ring-2 ring-[oklch] border highlight and background tint
- Local `useState<Task[]>` initialized from mockTasks manages task list within KanbanView
- All existing styling preserved (priority strips, avatars, badges, subtask progress, etc.)
- "Add task" button still works in each column

**Feature 2: Enhanced Search Dialog with Real Results** (`search-dialog.tsx`):
- Imported mockTasks, mockProjects, mockUsers from @/lib/mock-data
- Added useTranslation() for i18n support
- Added query state with `useState` for search input
- Added `useMemo` filtering logic for tasks (by title), projects (by name), users (by name)
- Results limited to 5 per category
- Added "Tasks" CommandGroup: matching tasks with status icon (color-coded) and priority dot/icon
- Added "Projects" CommandGroup: matching projects with color dot and progress percentage
- Added "Members" CommandGroup: matching users with avatar initials, online status dot, and role badge
- Clicking task result: sets activePage to 'tasks' AND opens task detail drawer via setSelectedTask
- Clicking project result: sets activePage to 'projects'
- Clicking member result: sets activePage to 'members'
- Proper icons for each group header from lucide-react
- Reset query on dialog close via onOpenChange handler (avoiding lint error with setState-in-effect)
- Added i18n keys `search.tasks`, `search.projects`, `search.members` to both FR and EN translations

**Feature 3: Integrate Task Detail Drawer** (`main-app.tsx` + `tasks-view.tsx`):
- Imported TaskDetailDrawer in main-app.tsx and rendered alongside NotificationPanel
- In KanbanView: each SortableTaskCard has onClick that calls `setSelectedTask(task)` from store
- In ListView: each task row has onClick that calls `setSelectedTask(task)` from store
- In MyTasksView: each task row has onClick that calls `setSelectedTask(task)` from store
- cursor-pointer already present on task cards and rows
- Drawer opens with selected task details when any task card is clicked

**Additional fixes:**
- Fixed pre-existing lint error in use-chat-socket.ts: removed redundant useEffect for channel switching that called setState in effect
- All lint errors resolved: `bun run lint` passes with 0 errors

Stage Summary:
- Kanban board now has full drag-and-drop between columns with visual feedback
- Search dialog searches through real tasks, projects, and members data
- Task detail drawer is integrated and opens on task click from all views
- 0 lint errors
- App compiling and serving successfully on port 3000

**Part 2: Real-time WebSocket Chat Service**:

1. **Chat Service Mini-Service** (`mini-services/chat-service/`):
   - Created `package.json` with socket.io dependency and dev script using `bun --hot index.ts`
   - Uses port **3003**
   - `index.ts` implements socket.io server with:
     - Tracks connected users with names/avatars in `connectedUsers` Map
     - Broadcasts messages to all clients in the same channel room (using socket.io rooms)
     - Emits `user_joined` / `user_left` events
     - Emits `user_typing` / `user_stop_typing` events
     - Stores last 50 messages per channel in memory (`channelMessages` Map)
     - Pre-populates with 10 sample messages across channels ch-1 through ch-4 on startup
     - Supports `join`, `switch_channel`, `send_message`, `typing`, `stop_typing` events
     - Graceful shutdown handlers for SIGTERM/SIGINT

2. **Frontend Socket Hook** (`src/hooks/use-chat-socket.ts`):
   - React hook connecting to WebSocket via `io("/?XTransformPort=3003")` (NEVER direct URL)
   - Provides: `messages`, `sendMessage`, `emitTyping`, `typingUsers`, `connectedUsers`, `isConnected`
   - Auto-joins channel on connect using Zustand store's `currentUser`
   - Switches channel room when channelId changes
   - Handles reconnection gracefully with socket.io built-in reconnection
   - Typing auto-stops after 3 seconds of inactivity
   - Avoids duplicate messages

3. **Updated Messages View** (`src/components/views/messages-view.tsx`):
   - Integrated `useChatSocket` hook replacing static mock data
   - Real-time messages from WebSocket displayed with existing UI styling
   - Typing indicators from other users shown with animated dots
   - Connection status indicator in sidebar (Wifi/WifiOff icon with color)
   - Connected users count shown in channel header
   - Message send calls `sendMessage` from hook
   - Input changes trigger `emitTyping` for typing indicators
   - All existing styling preserved (formatting toolbar, avatar colors, reactions, etc.)

4. **Dependencies**:
   - Installed `socket.io-client@4.8.3` in main project
   - Installed `socket.io@4.8.3` in chat-service mini-service

Stage Summary:
- Login page dramatically enhanced with 7 polish features (animated stats, testimonial, remember me, social hover, password toggle, shimmer overlay, i18n)
- Real-time WebSocket chat service running on port 3003 with channel rooms, typing indicators, user tracking
- Messages view fully integrated with live WebSocket for real-time chat
- 0 lint errors
- App compiling and serving successfully on port 3000
- Chat service running on port 3003

# Cron Review Round 2 — 2025-05-03

## Current Project Status

TeamFlow is a comprehensive collaborative project management web application.

**Tech Stack**: Next.js 16, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4, shadcn/ui, Framer Motion, Zustand, Prisma (SQLite), Socket.IO

**Features**: 14 views (Dashboard, Tasks, Projects, Calendar, Messages, Meetings, Files, Wiki, Activity, Members, Teams, Reports, Automations, Settings), login page, sidebar, top bar, search dialog (⌘K), notification panel, workspace creation dialog, task detail drawer, create task/project dialogs, keyboard shortcuts system, toast notifications (sonner), connection status indicator, page transitions, footer, real-time WebSocket chat, drag-and-drop kanban board, dark mode, i18n (FR/EN)

**Status**: Stable — 0 lint errors, 0 compilation errors, dev server running on :3000, chat service on :3003

## Completed This Round
1. **Dialog Integration**: CreateTaskDialog and CreateProjectDialog now store-controlled with toast feedback (sonner)
2. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Full system with visual help dialog (⌘K search, ⌘N new task, ⌘⇧N new project, ⌘\ sidebar, ⌘⇧I notifications, 1-8 nav, ? help)
3. **Sidebar Polish**: Gradient workspace switcher, Pro badge, glass search button, gradient active nav, hover border animations, new channel button, stacked avatars with +N, pulsing online dot, keyboard shortcuts hint
4. **TopBar Polish**: Search shadow + sparkle, teal ring on quick-create, online dot on user avatar, separator, notification bell shake animation
5. **Dashboard API Integration**: Connected to /api/tasks, /api/projects, /api/users with loading skeleton cards and error banner with retry
6. **Enhanced Search**: Recent items section, quick actions (toggle theme, show shortcuts), sparkle icon, teal focus border
7. **Connection Status Indicator**: Periodic health check every 30s, amber banner when offline with retry button
8. **Notification Panel Enhancement**: Per-type icons/colors, hover action buttons (mark read, dismiss), filter tabs (All/Unread/Mentions), styled date headers
9. **Task Drawer Enhancement**: Priority badges, status toggle dropdown with toast, subtask progress bar, comments section, activity log timeline, action buttons
10. **Page Transitions & Footer**: AnimatePresence fade/slide transitions, AppFooter with version/copyright/shortcuts hint
11. **New CSS Utilities**: dot-pattern, teal-glow, animate-float, skeleton-shimmer, animate-accent-border, drag-handle

## Unresolved Issues / Risks
1. **Agent-browser localhost access**: Headless Chrome cannot reach localhost in sandbox. QA relies on curl and code review.
2. **Chat service persistence**: Messages stored in memory only, lost on restart
3. **Dev server stability**: Process may die between commands; needs persistent start method

## Priority Recommendations for Next Phase
1. **File upload functionality** — Connect Files view to actual upload/download via API
2. **Real-time notifications via WebSocket** — Push new notifications to connected clients
3. **More views connected to Prisma API** — Tasks, Projects views should use database data
4. **Mobile responsive fine-tuning** — Test and polish all views for small screens
5. **Drag-and-drop within kanban columns** — Allow reordering tasks within a status column
6. **User profile editing** — Connect settings profile section to database
